# multimodal-transportation-optimization
A project on using mathematical programming to solve multi-modal transportation cost minimization in goods delivery.
## Project Overview
In delivery services, many different transportation tools such as trucks, airplanes and ships are available. Different choices of routes and transporation tools will lead to different costs. To accomplish cost minimization, we should consider goods consolidation (occassions when different goods share a journey together), different transportation costs and delivery time constraints etc. This project uses mathematical programming to model such situation and solves for cost minimization solution. The model is implemented with IBM Cplex API and numpy matrixing in python.
